# Example with integers


Initial min heap: [12, 14, 33, 45, 100]

Root node (min): 12

Popping min element: 12

Min heap after popping: [14, 45, 33, 100]


# Example with floats


Initial min heap: [12.3, 15.8, 13.1, 17.5, 51.7]

Root node (min): 12.3

Popping min element: 12.3

Min heap after popping: [13.1, 15.8, 51.7, 17.5]


# Example with custom data structures (e.g., tuples)


Initial min heap: [(11, 'orange'), (12, 'Blue'), (34, 'Yellow'), (47, 'Pink'), (29, 'Green')]

Root node (min): (11, 'orange')

Popping min element: (11, 'orange')

Min heap after popping: [(12, 'Blue'), (29, 'Green'), (34, 'Yellow'), (47, 'Pink')]
